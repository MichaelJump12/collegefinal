    <h2>INFORMATION ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>Our Sites are operated by Domino's Pizza UK & Ireland Limited ("<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>" or
        "<strong>us</strong>"). We are registered in England and Wales under company number 02882515 at 1 Thornbury,

    </p>
    <p>Domino's is a franchised business, where almost all Domino's stores (the "<strong>Store(s)</strong>") are owned
        and operated by independent Franchisees. We operate our Sites on behalf of our Franchisees.</p>
    <p>When we refer to the "Domino's Family" we mean Domino's Pizza UK & Ireland Limited (the franchisor) together with
        the Domino's Pizza franchisees who independently own and operate most of the Stores in the UK and Ireland.</p>
    <p>Each Franchisee is independently responsible for its own legal and regulatory compliance and for the operation of
        its own Store(s) and all compliance and other issues arising from any transactions with you. This means that
        each Franchisee is solely liable for all products you purchase from them whether via our Sites or in store.</p>
    <p>We accept orders on our Sites as agent on behalf of our Franchisees. The legal contract in relation to your order
        is between you and the Franchisee that operates the Store providing your order. Your order is subject to these
        terms and conditions.</p>
    <p>Apple Inc. is not a sponsor of, nor is it responsible for, any promotional offers within our iOS applications.
    </p>

    <h2>SERVICE AVAILABILITY</h2>
    <p>Subject to minimum delivery spends, Stores offer a delivery service to certain prescribed areas of the UK,
        Ireland, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man to ensure that our products are at their best when they reach your
        door. If you live outside a prescribed delivery area, you will not be able to have our products delivered to
        your door although you may collect any products you order from your chosen Store.</p>
    <p>We do not accept orders from individuals to a country in which we do not have a Store.</p>
    <p>For the safety of our drivers, a driver will only deliver to the main door/reception when delivering to apartment
        blocks, flats or hotels and they carry less than Â£10.</p>

    <h2>ORDERING</h2>
    <p><strong>You may only place orders if you are at least 18 years old</strong>. By ordering, you warrant that you
        are at least 18 years old and you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts.</p>
    <p>If you place an order via our Sites, you will be presented with confirmation on your screen that your order has
        been received and accepted by our Franchisee. Your contract with the Franchisee is only formed when you have
        been presented with this confirmation.</p>
    <p>You will also receive a confirmation email. Please make sure that the email address, home address and telephone
        number you provide are correct and in proper working order, as these are required to fulfil your order. Please
        also ensure that, where you have placed an order for collection, you have ordered from the correct Store.</p>
    <p>If you place an order in a Store, your contract will be formed when you receive your receipt of purchase.</p>
    <p>If you order using the 'Easy Order' button on our Sites, you are responsible for ensuring that your store
        preferences and 'saved order' details are up to date, along with your payment card information. If your saved
        store preferences indicate that you wish to order for collection from a particular store, please check your
        order confirmation email carefully in case your preferred store is unable to fulfil your order.</p>
    <p>Customers should note that Domino's uses a feature, Auto-Deal Wizard (currently on our website not on mobile
        apps), in order to calculate and provide customers with the best deals and offers when ordering. Although
        Domino's always endeavours to provide the best deals, offers and savings, this may not always be possible due to
        the extremely large number of possible permutations that could be available for any one transaction. Domino's
        does not warrant, express or imply that we shall provide customers with the best deals, offers and savings at
        all times when ordering.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely scenario that you place an order on our Sites for collection from a store that is unable to
        fulfil your order, for example, if the store is closed, your order will be redirected to an alternative open
        local store. You should check your order confirmation email carefully before travelling to collect your order.
        Please contact us straight away if your order has been redirected to an alternative store and you wish to cancel
        your order.</p>
    </p>Our Franchisees provide a quality service. We accept no responsibility or liability for the quality or quantity
    of any products delivered by or collected from a Franchisee. All food preparation and deliveries are the sole
    responsibility of the Franchisee accepting your order.</p>

    <h2>PRODUCTS</h2>
    <p>All products are subject to availability. In most cases, our Franchisee will offer an alternative for any
        out-of-stock item. Some Franchisees do not sell all of our products.</p>
    <p>We do not use nuts in our products, however, some ingredients are produced in factories that handle nuts and some
        ice creams contain nuts. For full ingredient lists, nutritional and allergen information see here.</p>
    <p>Stores are busy working environments and there is a risk of cross-contamination between toppings. If you have an
        allergy we kindly ask that you <strong><u>do not order online</u></strong>. Instead, please telephone your
        chosen Store and inform your order-taker at the Store directly in full of your allergies.</p>
    <p>We do have a number of options available for vegetarians which are indicated on our menus. We also have
        procedures in place for making pizzas that are suitable for vegetarians however please note that we do not have
        a dedicated preparation or cooking area in our stores for vegetarian food. If you are a vegetarian please inform
        your order-taker who will do their best to ensure that any risk of cross-contamination with your order is
        minimised.</p>
    <p>We have strict procedures in place for making pizzas that are suitable for vegans, however, please note that we
        do not have a dedicated preparation or cooking area in our stores for vegan food. If you order a vegan pizza the
        store will do their utmost to ensure that the risk of cross-contamination with your order is minimised.</p>
    <p>Great care is taken in the preparation of all our products, however, we cannot guarantee that all bones from meat
        products have been removed and some may remain. Olives may contain stones.</p>
    <p>Cooked ham is formed from cured pork legs with added water. Ground beef, chicken breast strips and smoked bacon
        rashers contain added water.</p>
    <p>Some products may have been previously frozen.</p>
    <p>Our pizzas are handmade to order with fresh dough. The images of our products contained on our menus and Sites
        are for illustrative purposes only. Although we try our hardest to be consistent, at times, the size of the
        bases can vary and products you order may vary slightly from those images.</p>
    <p>Gluten free pizzas are available on an 8.5" base only.</p>
    <p>Our Delight range of pizzas are only under 650 calories with no extra toppings ordered in a size small. As our
        pizzas are freshly hand made to order, calories on each pizza may vary.</p>

    <h2>AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY</h2>
    <p>We strive to maintain our excellent reputation for on-time delivery. However, unfortunately, things do not always
        go to plan and factors outside of our control such as the weather and traffic conditions may occasionally
        prevent us from achieving this.</p>
    <p>Some of our Franchisees are now offering dynamic delivery and collection times. Our Franchisees will do their
        best to fulfil your order by the dynamic delivery and collection times displayed to you. However, these timings
        are estimates only and our Franchisees do not guarantee the accuracy of the dynamic delivery and collection
        timer. This means that you wonât be entitled to cancel your order or claim compensation if your order isnât
        fulfilled by the dynamic delivery or collection time displayed. Should you be unsatisfied with your order you
        can follow the standard process available to all customers and contact our Customer Services team via our
        Contact Form.</p>
    <p>Delivery isn't easy - but we've had a lot of practice in getting it right. That's why we don't support the use of
        third party delivery service companies to deliver our food. Trust the experts. We like to deliver the pizza
        ourselves as it allows us to maintain high standards and ensure that you are delivered a piping hot pizza.</p>
    <p>Our Franchisee will do its best to fulfil your order in accordance with the date and time confirmed to you at the
        time of your order.</p>
    <p>If your order is for delivery and you have requested delivery 'asap', our Franchisee will do its best to fulfil
        your order within a reasonable time of your confirmation email, taking into account the volume of orders and
        circumstances facing the Franchisee at the time. For a real time update of your order, you can click on the
        Pizza Tracker link provided on the confirmation screen.</p>
    <p>Delivery charges may apply, please ask in store for details.</p>

    <h2>CANCELLATION</h2>
    <p>You have the right to cancel an order by telephoning the relevant Store up until either:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>in the case of any advance order (which is/are order(s) placed more than one day before a requested delivery
            date), up to one day before the order is due to be delivered; or</li>
        <li>in the case of same day orders and deliveries, within a reasonable time prior to any food being used to
            start preparing your order.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you wish to cancel an order after food has been used to start preparing it, you may, at the Franchisee's sole
        discretion, be charged the full price of the order and no refund will be due to you.</p>
    <p>In the unfortunate circumstance that the Franchisee needs to cancel your order after it has been accepted, the
        Franchisee will notify you. We and our Franchisees reserve the right to cancel any order, before or after
        acceptance, and will notify you immediately of any such cancellation.</p>
    <p>You will not be charged for any orders we or our Franchisees cancel. Any payment made prior to an order being
        cancelled by us or our Franchisee will typically be reimbursed using the same method originally used by you to
        pay for your purchase.</p>

    <h2>PRICE AND PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>Prices are as quoted on our menus, Sites and in store and may change from time to time, although changes will not
        affect orders already placed (unless due to a technical error). Prices include VAT. Prices are set by each
        Franchisee and will vary between Stores. Each Franchisee will typically verify prices as part of the order
        process and its decision in relation to pricing is final and binding.</p>
    <p>The price applicable for a 'Half and Half' pizza using standard menu toppings are based on the most expensive
        half.</p>
    </p>Payments, for orders placed via the Sites, are made directly to us and subsequently passed to the relevant
    Franchisee. Payments, for orders placed in stores, are made directly to the Franchisee.</p>

    <h2>OUR LIABILITY</h2>
    <p>If we and/or a Franchisee fail to comply with these terms, we and/or the Franchisee (as applicable) are
        responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of the breach of these terms or
        negligence, up to the amount of the purchase price you paid for the order applicable to your claim.</p>
    <p>However, we and/or the Franchisee (as applicable) are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not
        foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of a breach or if it would reasonably
        be contemplated by you, us and the Franchisee at the time of your purchase.</p>
    <p>We and our Franchisees only supply products for private and business use. You agree not to use any product for
        commercial or re-sale purposes and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business,
        business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>
    <p>We, and our Franchisees, do not exclude or limit our liability for:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>death or personal injury caused by our, or our Franchisee's, negligence;</li>
        <li>fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or</li>
        <li>any liability which cannot legally be limited or excluded.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>WRITTEN COMMUNICATION</h2>
    <p>Applicable laws require that some of the information or communications we send to you should be in writing. When
        using the Sites, you accept that communication with us will be mainly electronic. We will contact you by email
        or provide you with information by posting notices on the Sites. For contractual purposes, you agree to
        electronic means of communication and you acknowledge that all contracts, notices, information and other
        communications that we provide to you electronically comply with any legal requirement that such communications
        be in writing. This condition does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
    <p>If you wish to contact us or a Franchisee at any time, you should contact us using our Contact Form or contact
        the Franchisee at your local Store.</p>

    <h2>EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL</h2>
    <p>We and our Franchisees will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of,
        any of our obligations under a contract that is caused by events outside our reasonable control (a
        "<strong>Force Majeure Event</strong>").</p>
    <p>A Force Majeure Event includes any act, event, non-happening, omission or accident beyond both our reasonable
        control and the reasonable control of our Franchisees and includes in particular (without limitation) the
        following:</p>
    <ol type="a">

        <li>the acts, decrees, legislation, regulations or restrictions of any government; or</li>
        <li>non-performance by suppliers or subcontractors.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>WAIVER</h2>
    <p>If we or our Franchisees fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms and
        conditions, or if we or our Franchisees do not enforce our rights against you, or delay in doing so, that will
        not mean that we or our Franchisees have waived our rights against you or that you do not have to comply with
        those obligations. If we or our Franchisees waive a default by you, this will only be done in writing, and will
        not mean that we or our Franchisees will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>

    <h2>SEVERABILITY</h2>
    <p>Each of the paragraphs of these terms and conditions operates separately. If any court or relevant authority
        decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and
        effect.</p>

    <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
    <p>We or our Franchisees may transfer our rights and obligations under any contract with you to another
        organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms and conditions. You may
        only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms and conditions to another person if we agree in
        writing.</p>

    <h2>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
    <p>These terms and conditions and any document expressly referred to in them represent the entire agreement in
        relation to the subject matter of any contract and supersede any prior agreement, understanding or arrangement
        between you, us and our Franchisees, whether oral or in writing.</p>

    <h2>VARIATION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
    <p>We have the right to amend these terms and conditions from time to time. Any changes we make to these terms and
        conditions will be posted on this page. You will be subject to the policies and terms and conditions in force at
        the time that you order, unless any change to those policies or these terms and conditions is required to be
        made by law or governmental authority.</p>

    <h2>THIRD PARTY RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>No one other than a party to these terms and conditions shall have any right to enforce any of its terms and
        conditions.</p>

    <h2>LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>
    <p>Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with your order or their subject matter or formation
        (including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by English law. Any dispute or claim arising out
        of or in connection with such contracts or their formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall
        be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
